## Engine Guide & Templates

This repo serves solely to provide starting points for projects through links to documentation/prepared projects (in Unity). 

The Unity project provides a fairly standard project structure to inspire good file organisation & project structure.

## Unity

Unity do provide downloadable "templates" to build your game from in the Hub, but they are very bare. I decided to provide a small set of projects already set up with assets/prefabs/scripts. 

The version of Unity these projects require is [Unity 6000.0.40f1](https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/6000.0.40#installs), the latest LTS version at time of writing.

The [Unity](Unity) projects are simple 2D & 3D "games" configured to build to WebGL already. They produce a simple rendered moving image on browsers. 

The project has a very simple structure, set up to help succeed with organised files & assets, which we all know can quickly fall apart when you are in the weeds during a hackathon/game jam! 

## GameMaker

GameMaker thankfully provides very well fleshed out templates in their launcher. They can be found in the Start Page. More info found [here](https://manual.gamemaker.io/monthly/en/#t=Introduction%2FThe_Start_Page.htm#Starting_A_New_Project)

We also have the GameMaker team supporting during the event, so they may be able to help with issues you have here!

## Godot

Godot has a community supported set of templates through the [Asset Library](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset?category=8)

These can serve as good starting points for any projects as well. There is a large community of developers working in Godot, as well as the engine itself being open-source, meaning you are free to build whatever is not there for you (it is fairly feature complete these days).

## Unreal Engine

Unreal Engine 5.5 has built in starter projects & templates to speed up the boilerplate as well. The documentation covers this as well [here](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/unreal-engine-templates-reference)

The Unreal Engine templates allow you to set up many of the popular styles/genres of games with a starter player already configured. This is considerably quicker to get up & running, combined with blueprints, is easier for many non-programmers to work with. The trade-off tends to be performance requirements are much higher for base games in UE5.
